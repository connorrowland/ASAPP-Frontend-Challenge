## Project Details
<dl>
  <dd>Rob and Laura can send and receive messages to each other in a way that mirrors a traditional digital messaging experience. Rob and Laura can also send reactions to each other with their messages by clicking on the three dots next to "Send."</dd>

  <dd>I used HTML, SCSS, React.js, and Jest to create this application. I also used <a href="https://www.reactboilerplate.com">react-boilerplate</a> to generate the application's file scaffolding.</dd>
