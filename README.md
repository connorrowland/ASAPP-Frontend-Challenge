## ASAPP Frontend Challenge
A split screen chat interface built with React.js by Connor Rowland.

## Project Details
Rob and Laura can send and receive messages to each other in a way that mirrors a traditional digital messaging experience. Rob and Laura can also send reactions to each other with their messages by clicking on the three dots next to "Send."

I used HTML, SCSS, React.js, and Jest to create this application. I also used [react-boilerplate](https://www.reactboilerplate.com) to generate the application's file scaffolding.

## Setup: OS X
- Make sure you've installed Node.js version 8 or higher.
- Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/connorrowland/ASAPP-Frontend-Challenge.git`.
- Install the app dependencies: `npm install`.
- Run `npm start` to start the development server.
- The project will run at `http://localhost:3000`.
